# Chess

A simple chess game implemented in Java using a graphical user interface.

## Requirements
- Java JDK 17 (or the version you are using)
- No global Gradle installation required (Gradle Wrapper included)

## Project Structure
- `src/` – Java source code
- `res/` – Game resources (piece images, etc.)
- `build.gradle` – Gradle build configuration

## Build
To compile the project, run:

```bash
./gradlew build
```
(On Windows: gradlew build)

## Run
To run the application:

```bash
./gradlew run
```
(On Windows: gradlew run)

## Notes
- This project uses the Gradle Wrapper, so Gradle does not need to be installed separately.
- Build output is generated in the build/ directory.
- The project follows a simple custom source layout (src/ and res/).
